# rest-api-messenger-test

This source code is used while learning Rest Web Services in one of the Java Brains tutorials.
The difference with the original course is that I added a database connection.
The database used is MongoDB. To connect to the database we used Spring Data. So we had to do a few changes to have Jersey and Spring working together.

It is still on development as I'm doing the course right now.

To have this source working you need a MongoDB instance locally.

The source of the original course is here:
