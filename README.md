# Developing REST APIs with JAX-RS - Jersey, MongoDB Database and Spring Data

This source code is used while learning Rest Web Services in one of the Java Brains tutorial Developing REST APIs with JAX-RS.
The difference with the original course is that I added a database connection.
The database used is MongoDB. To connect to the database we use Spring Data. So we had to do a few changes to have Jersey and Spring working together.

It is still on development as I'm doing the course right now.

To have this source working you need a MongoDB instance locally.

The source of the original course is here:

Note that I didn't fork the original source, I started from scratch while making the course.
Also note that this source has a lot of changes to the original course code because I try to use the magic of Spring Data.
